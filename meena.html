			<h2>When memory decides<br>
To no longer bear the burdens—<br>
Of pain, or even plain indifference<br>
She has her winsome wicked ways.<br>
<br>
Some day, years later,<br>
Life requires you to unearth<br>
Some event long past and you<br>
Set about browsing your brain<br>
Like a desk-full of office files and then—<br>
Come across a resounding emptiness.<br>
<br>
Memories drizzle-fragile<br>
Are not to be found. What<br>
Greets you instead, through<br>
Those yellowing sheets of typed matter is<br>
The blank and ugly blotches of dried whitener<br>
So carefully applied, then. It has a fading smell of<br>
Chalk and chlorine: a blend, like memory, that works at<br>
Your throat. You try to scratch it and the faintest hopes are<br>
Betrayed as the caked pieces of the whitener crumble,<br>
Displaying nothing, but toe curling holes where crummy paper and ink once contained you.</h2><p>- Amnesia, Selective -</p>

			<h3> Their daughters<br><br>Paracetamol legends I know
For rising fevers, as pain-relievers—

Of my people—father’s father’s mother’s
Mother, dark lush hair caressing her ankles
Sometimes, sweeping earth, deep-honey skin,
Amber eyes—not beauty alone they say—she
Married a man who murdered thirteen men and one
Lonely summer afternoon her rice-white teeth tore
Through layers of khaki, and golden white skin to spill
The bloodied guts of a British soldier who tried to colonize her. . .

Of my land—uniform blue open skies,
Mad-artist palettes of green lands and lily-filled lakes that
Mirror all—not peace or tranquil alone, he shudders—some
Young woman near my father’s home, with a drunken husband
Who never changed; she bore his beatings everyday until on one
Stormy night, in fury, she killed him by stomping his seedbags. . .

We: their daughters.
We: the daughters of their soil.

We, mostly, write.</h3>

			<h2>Ours is a silence<br>
that waits. Endlessly waits.<br>
<br>
And then, unable to bear it<br>
any further, it breaks into wails.<br>
<br>
But not all suppressed reactions<br>
end in our bemoaning the tragedy.<br>
<br>
Sometimes,<br>
the outward signals<br>
of inward struggles takes colossal forms<br>
And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.<br>
<br>
Most of the time:<br>
<br><p>
AGGRESSION</p> is the best kind of trouble-shooting.</h2>
